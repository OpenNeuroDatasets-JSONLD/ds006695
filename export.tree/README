# UCSD Forehead Patch Sleep Validation Dataset

Curated EEG recordings for validating sleep staging from a three electrode forehead patch against standard 33 channel polysomnography. Notes from June to September 2025 define the alignment policy used here.

## What is included
- CGX patch `.set` files that contain `EEG.VisualHypnogram` and `EEG.SpectralScoring`
- Cap EEG as `.set` and or EDF. EDF does not embed scores. Visual scoring files for EDF are separate.

## Sleep stage labels
`EEG.VisualHypnogram` is manual scoring in 30 second epochs using the following integers

1 equals Wake  
2 equals REM  
3 equals N1  
4 equals N2  
5 equals N3  
0 equals unknown or movement

`EEG.SpectralScoring` is spectral staging from the forehead patch. One row per patch channel. One column per 30 second epoch.

## Alignment policy
Cap and patch do not always start and stop at the same clock times. CGX patch data were first cut to the cap start time from a spreadsheet. If that made the patch shorter than the visual hypnogram, the end of the visual hypnogram was trimmed so that visual and patch lengths matched. EDF and CGX files were not further forced to identical durations. Small second level mismatches remain. If you need the visual hypnogram aligned to EDF, crop signal after the last complete 30 second epoch.

## Trimming exceptions
Times are seconds removed from the beginning of the CGX patch unless noted. “cut visual end” means the visual hypnogram was shortened at its end after the begin trim.

| participant_id | begin_trim_sec | cut_visual_end | notes |
|---:|---:|:---:|:---|
| 101 | 770 | yes |  |
| 102 | 325 | yes |  |
| 104 | 2075.7 | no |  |
| 105 | 568 | yes |  |
| 106 | 1197 | yes |  |
| 114 | 210 shift | yes | also removed approx first hour |
| 119 | 1034 | yes |  |

All other included subjects followed the general policy without additional exceptions.

## Subject exclusions
113 and 121 are excluded. CGX patch was inadequate or unavailable.

## Practical guidance
Treat `EEG.VisualHypnogram` as ground truth for modeling. Align it to the patch signal using the begin trims above. For multi system analyses that require synchrony with the cap, use the cap clock and crop the patch to the cap end. For EDF alignment, crop signal to the last full 30 second epoch.
