# UCSD Forehead Patch Sleep Validation Dataset

Curated EEG recordings for validating sleep staging from a three-electrode forehead patch against standard 33-channel polysomnography (not included in this release -- this release only includes the three-electrode data).

## What is included
- CGX patch `.set` files that contain `EEG.VisualHypnogram` and `EEG.SpectralScoring`

## Sleep stage labels
`EEG.VisualHypnogram` is manual scoring in 30-second epochs using the following integers

1 equals Wake  
2 equals REM  
3 equals N1  
4 equals N2  
5 equals N3  
0 equals unknown or movement

`EEG.SpectralScoring` is spectral staging from the forehead patch. One row per patch channel. One column per 30-second epoch (see publication).

## Alignment policy
33-channel cap and patch do not always start and stop at the same clock times. CGX patch data were first cut to the cap start time from a spreadsheet. If that made the patch shorter than the visual hypnogram, the end of the visual hypnogram was trimmed so that visual and patch lengths matched. EDF and CGX files were not further forced to identical durations. Small second-level mismatches remain.

## Subject exclusions
113 and 121 are excluded. The CGX patch was inadequate or unavailable.
